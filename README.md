# AutoOptimize

Do you want your calculation to go faster but are also too lazy to
optimize your code? Well I have a solution for you! Introducing the
AutoOptimize system. With a simple `]add AutoOptimize`, we'll send
it straight to your home and SHIPPING IS FREE! In seconds your
calculations will be taking seconds. So what do you have to lose?
Here, come on in and I'll show you how to use it.

## Making Code Fast, the Lazy Way

Define an ODEProblem, `prob`. Alright, I'll wait for you to catch
up. Now call:

```julia
_prob = auto_optimize(prob)
```

Now `_prob` is better, so go use that one.
